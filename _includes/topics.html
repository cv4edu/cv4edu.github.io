								The workshop topics include (but are not limited to): 
							</p>
								<div>
								<ul>
									<li>Multimodal perception in classrooms: face, gaze, pose, gesture, posture, affect, prosody/speech dynamics, turn‑taking, task objects (board/projector, notebooks, lab materials)</li>
									<li>Robustness &amp; generalization: domain shift beyond the lab, few‑/low‑shot learning, continual and on‑device adaptation under occlusions, varying camera placements, seating layouts, multi‑party and multimodal dynamics.</li>
									<li>Construct inference, interpretability &amp; measurement validity: end‑to‑end mapping from vision features to learning‑science constructs using interdisciplinary codebooks (e.g., deriving behaviors that are ecologically valid requires codebook), reliability (inter‑rater/test–retest), calibration/uncertainty, and validity evidence.</li>
									<li>Data, benchmarks, and protocols: curation/annotation aligned with educational constructs, consent &amp; documentation norms/regulations, unified pre‑/post‑processing, privacy‑preserving datasets and learning (e.g., model‑weight sharing/privacy preserving approaches).</li>
									<li>Case studies and deployments: human‑in‑the‑loop tools, human-AI frameworks, classroom feedback systems, and equitable uses.</li>
